I am generally interested in software and how to develop/build/run it, and I find the learning process rewarding. To reinforce and help me remember what I learn I find it helpful to write it down as I go along. Doing that in public as I&rsquo;m doing here is a little bit scary, but hopefully it will push me to do a little bit better than just notes in a notebook just for myself. I hope this will also help me let me know if I know the topic as well as I think I do or not. If I can&rsquo;t explain it well enough to to others so I think they would understand it, I probably don&rsquo;t. I find it is also helpful having my own words to look back on if and when I want to revisit a subject.

        <p>I&rsquo;m writing this before I&rsquo;ve even begun, so what this blog will eventually be
about is actually unknown at this point in time. I have a plan, though.</p>
<p>I am generally interested in software and how to develop/build/run it, and I find
the learning process rewarding. To reinforce and help me remember what I learn I
find it helpful to write it down as I go along. Doing that in public as I&rsquo;m doing
here is a little bit scary, but hopefully it will push me to do a little bit
better than just notes in a notebook just for myself. I hope this will also help
me let me know if I know the topic as well as I think I do or not. If I can&rsquo;t
explain it well enough to to others so I think they would understand it, I
probably don&rsquo;t. I find it is also helpful having my own words to look back on if
and when I want to revisit a subject.</p>
<p>Another thing I wanted to try my hand at is running my own server, and then use
that opportunity to write abut what I learn in doing so.</p>
<p>On to the nitty-gritty technical details, the server is running <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a>
which may be an untraditional choice. I&rsquo;ll get back to why I prefer Caddy over
httpd (possibly with relayd) and even nginx later.</p>
<p>The posts are written in simple markdown files and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> then builds the pages you
are looking at right now from that. The styling comes from the theme <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/">terminal</a>.</p>
<p>The name of the blog, noexec, comes from the mount option available on OpenBSD.
With it enabled on a partition, no executables can be run on that partition
which I think is a very nice security feature.</p>
