        <h2 id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Having just ordered an OpenBSD VPS which is now online and exposed to the world,
I want to lock it down a little by changing the SSH config as well as the firewall
rules.</p>
<h2 id="ssh">SSH<a href="#ssh" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I like to start by disabling direct root-login, as well as disabling password
logins. The reason being that there are bots constantly scanning every IPv4
address on the internet, looking for known vulnerabilities I guess, as well as
some bots trying to log in through SSH. By disabling password-logins
you efficiently stop their brute-force attempts on passwords, and if you have <code>doas</code>
set up like you should, there is no reason to log in directly as root either.</p>
<p>If you follow what I am doing here, be a little careful so you don&rsquo;t
inadvertently lock yourself out, or be prepared to log in on the console to fix
your mistake. It&rsquo;s probably a good idea to try the console login before making
changes like this to make sure you can recover if something goes bad.</p>
<p>I edit <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> with <code>vi</code> using doas, and find the <code>PermitRootLogin</code>
line. As this is written after the fact, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what was necessary
to do, but the end result is that the line should be uncommented and contain the
value <code>no</code> like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PermitRootLogin no
</code></pre><p>Then I found the <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> line, uncommented it and again made sure the value was <code>no</code>,
and finally did the same for the <code>KbdInteractiveAuthentication</code> line.</p>
<p>I saved the file and restarted sshd to make the changes take effect: <code>doas rcctl restart sshd</code></p>
<p>Here the fun begins. If I have made any mistakes I could lock myself out of the server.
Fortunately the connection was kept, so I let that window be, and in another window tried to
log in with SSH again. It worked! If not I could have used the previous window and connection
to fix my mistake, but that was not necessary this time.</p>
<h2 id="firewall">Firewall<a href="#firewall" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>The next order of business I would say is to close down the firewall. The default rules are quite
permissive, as they allow connections to every port as long as they are &ldquo;correct&rdquo; and would be
able to establish a stateful-connection. TCP packets containing just the F-flag or something
similar would not be allowed, as that is not how you establish a TCP connection.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set skip on lo

block return   # block stateless traffic
pass           # establish keep-state

# By default, do not permit remote connections to X11
block return in on ! lo0 proto tcp to port 6000:6010

# Port build user does not need network
block return out log proto {tcp udp} user _pbuild
</code></pre><p>The reason I&rsquo;m putting this second is because OpenBSD doesn&rsquo;t run many network
services by default, so there aren&rsquo;t many ports open to the internet. On this
VM it&rsquo;s only two, SSH and DHCP.</p>
<p>I have a somewhat static ip-address which I have for months at a time, so I&rsquo;ve
set up SSH to only be available from my address. DHCP only needs outgoing
traffic to the best of my knowledge so I only allow that.</p>
<p>I also prefer to simply drop traffic and not return anything to make it seem
like the IP of the server is not in use.</p>
<p>If your ip is very dynamic so you need to allow logins from everyone, replace
the ip address with the word <code>any</code>.</p>
<p>My initial, revised rules then looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>set skip on lo

block drop
pass out on vio0

## SSH
pass in from 192.0.2.2 to any port 22

# To allow ssh for everyone, remove the previous line and add this instead:
# pass in from any to any port 22

# Explicitly allow outgoing dhcp
pass out proto udp from any port 68 to any port 67

# Port build user does not need network
block return out log proto {tcp udp} user _pbuild
</code></pre><p>These rules so far break IPv6 connectivity, but I will fix next. It took
a bit of experimentation though, so I feel it requires some more documentation.</p>
<p>The IP here is not my actual IP, but one made available for documentation pruposes.
It should not be routed on the internet.</p>
<p><code>pf</code> rules follows the &ldquo;last match wins&rdquo; paradigm, that is why the block rule
is so high up in the rules. Since I now have a &ldquo;default block&rdquo; rule, I removed
the X11 rule for ports 6000-6010 as it is not needed.</p>
<p>Now to allow incoming SSH connections using IPv6 I&rsquo;ll add a rule like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># If I have a /64 subnet on IPv6 which is like one IPv4 address:
pass in proto tcp from 2001:db8:3003:4004::/64 to any port 22

# Or, since IPv6 address space is so large it isn&#39;t being scanned:
pass in proto tcp from any to 2001:db8:1001:2002::2 port 22
</code></pre><p>Now I have two rules to allow incoming tcp to port 22. There&rsquo;s a way to avoid
that by using tables, but I&rsquo;ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>Having the allow rule for IPv6 is a start, but to actually get IPv6 connectivity
working again, or to have it keep working, I&rsquo;ve come up with these rules:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pass in quick inet6 proto icmp6 from fe80::/64 to ff02::1:ff00:0/104 icmp6-type 135 no state
pass out quick inet6 proto icmp6 from fe80::/64 to ff02::1:ff00:0/104 icmp6-type 135 no state

pass in quick inet6 proto icmp6 from fe80::/64 to fe80::/64 icmp6-type { 135 136 } no state
pass out quick inet6 proto icmp6 to fe80::/64 icmp6-type { 135 136 } no state

pass in quick inet6 proto icmp6 from 2001:db8:1001:2002::1 to 2001:db8:1001:2002::2 icmp6-type 135 no state
pass out quick inet6 proto icmp6 from 2001:db8:1001:2002::2 to 2001:db8:1001:2002::1 icmp6-type 136 no state
</code></pre><p>Icmp6-type 135 is neighbor solicitation and type 136 is neighbor advertisement. These types are easily
found with <code>man icmp6</code>, but it just struck me, why do I need to find and input them?
Looking at the rules that are in effect with <code>pfctl -sr</code> shows &ldquo;neighbrsol&rdquo; and &ldquo;neighbradv&rdquo; instead
of 135 or 136. I did a quick check and learned I can indeed use the words instead of
the type id, so I&rsquo;ll be changing my rules to use the words instead from now on.</p>
<p>For some reason <code>pf</code> and <code>tcpdump</code> seems to use different abbreviations, so I can&rsquo;t
simply copy to text from tcpdump unfortunately.</p>
<p>Capturing icmp6 traffic with tcpdump looks something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fe80::my:mac &gt; ff02::1:ff00:1: icmp6: neighbor sol: who has 2001:db8:1001:2002::1
fe80::router:mac &gt; fe80::my:mac: icmp6: neighbor adv: tgt is 2001:db8:1001:2002::1

2001:db8:1001:2002::1 &gt; 2001:db8:1001:2002::2: icmp6: neighbor sol: who has 2001:db8:1001:2002::2

fe80::my:mac &gt; fe80::router:mac: icmp6: neighbor sol: who has fe80::router:mac
fe80::router:mac &gt; fe80::my:mac: icmp6: neighbor adv: tgt is fe80::router:mac
</code></pre><p>My understanding of IPv6 is quite limited so I can&rsquo;t really explain how this
works. I have done some research and found that addresses beginning with fe80
are &ldquo;link local&rdquo;, and thus aren&rsquo;t routed on the internet. I could probably be
more relaxed with them but I like to close down the firewall as much as
possible. For my VM, they seem to contain my MAC address which is something
I&rsquo;m not sure I should give away, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve removed it.</p>
<p>The address beginning with ff02 is a &ldquo;solicited-node multicast address&rdquo;, and
I&rsquo;m just going link to the Wikipedia article about it which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicited-node_multicast_address">here</a>.
I guess it is sort of a broadcast address sent to everyone on the same link
to discover who is there, and have them respond with their address.</p>
<p>All of this is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol">neighbor discovery protocol</a>
which I don&rsquo;t really understand, but is needed for IPv6 to work.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia page on the protocol lists other types such as 133 and 134 for router
solicitation and router advertisement, but I&rsquo;ve not seen that on the network
and don&rsquo;t know why that is. Perhaps it&rsquo;s due to how the provider has configured
their network, I don&rsquo;t know. In any case, that is why my rules only contain
types 135 and 136.</p>
<p>The VM I&rsquo;m using uses DHCP to get its IPv4 address, but while the IPv6 address
is assigned statically, it needs this discovery protocol to work. I learned that
the hard way by blocking icmp6 completely and while it worked fine for a while,
all of a sudden I couldn&rsquo;t reach the IPv6 address anymore, until I enabled this again.</p>
<p>So to iterate, having a rule allowing incoming traffic to some TCP port is not
enough for IPv6. When someone tries to connect, the router will broadcast messages
asking who has the destination IP, and if that is not answered, it won&rsquo;t be
possible to connect.</p>
<p>I could maybe use stateful rules (I removed that here by using &ldquo;no state&rdquo;) to limit
the number of rules needed, but there was so much traffic and I didn&rsquo;t
like seeing it in the state table as it made the other traffic hard to see.</p>
<p>This is definately something I need to get back to. The firewall rules seems to be working for now,
but I may have broken something I&rsquo;ll only find out about later down the line.</p>
<p>Edit 2025-04-28: Yes I had, by only allowing neighbor sol incoming from default gateway,
I had blocked neighbor adv which means my VM didn&rsquo;t get those responses when it asked
with &ldquo;neighbor sol&rdquo;. I discovered that as I saw my host sending multiple &ldquo;neighbor sol&rdquo; messages and
the router seemingly responding fine. If my VM had received the answer properly instead
of it being dropped by the firewall, my VM should have only asked once.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>2001:db8:1001:2002::2 &gt; 2001:db8:1001:2002::1: icmp6: neighbor sol: who has 2001:db8:1001:2002::1
2001:db8:1001:2002::1 &gt; 2001:db8:1001:2002::2: icmp6: neighbor adv: tgt is 2001:db8:1001:2002::1

</code></pre><p>The fix was to add neighbradv to these rules so I allow both neighbor sol and neighbor adv incoming
and outgoing to and from the default gateway:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pass in quick inet6 proto icmp6 from 2001:db8:1001:2002::1 to 2001:db8:1001:2002::2 icmp6-type { neighbrsol neighbradv } no state
pass out quick inet6 proto icmp6 from 2001:db8:1001:2002::2 to 2001:db8:1001:2002::1 icmp6-type { neighbrsol neighbradv } no state
</code></pre><p>I already have a rule that allows all outgoing traffic, but I like having
explicit rules for this as well, in case I should change the &ldquo;allow all out&rdquo;
rule later.</p>
<p>Now to verify that the syntax of the rules are ok with <code>pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf</code>,
and if so, cross fingers, hope for the best and load them with <code>pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</code>.</p>
<p>Phew, it worked. I wasn&rsquo;t really concerned though, as long as my IP is the one
being allowed to connect to SSH I should always be able to get back in.</p>
<h2 id="timezone">Timezone<a href="#timezone" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Server time was set to Europe/Amsterdam which isn&rsquo;t unnatural when you consider its
location, but I prefer having time set to UTC to avoid the daylight savings mess.
One reason: logs that will log the hour 2 in the morning twice when the clocks are
turned back, or skip it when the clocks are turned forward.</p>
<p>Current timezone can be found with <code>ls -l /etc/localtime</code>. Since it&rsquo;s a symlink it can
be changed manually to any of the files in <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> but I use zic:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>doas zic -l UTC
</code></pre><h2 id="prompt">Prompt<a href="#prompt" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I use the default shell in OpenBSD which is ksh. I don&rsquo;t like the default prompt
though so I change it by setting PS1 like this in <code>~/.profile</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PS1=&#34;\t \u@\h:\w$ &#34;
</code></pre><p>The result looks like this if I am in the docs directory in my home directory:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>20:34:12 user@obsd-web:~/docs$
</code></pre><p>In other words: \t is current time, \u is current user, \h is the hostname
and \w is current directory, shortened with ~ in front for anything in the home directory.</p>
