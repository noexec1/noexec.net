        <h2 id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I thought I would start by sharing my experience of ordering and setting up an
OpenBSD VPS on OpenBSD.Amsterdam. Before I begin, I have no affiliation with
them so I gain nothing should you decide to order from them, and I am paying for
this server out of my own pocket.</p>
<h2 id="ordering">Ordering<a href="#ordering" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Looking around on their page, they have quite a lot of information about their
setup, so it should be easy to see what the options are and what you are getting.</p>
<p>I would like to point out a few things which I think is unique with this
provider. First off, the hosts are also running OpenBSD, using <code>vmm/vmd</code> to
provide virtualization. If you click on the &ldquo;xxx VMs deployed&rdquo; link in the top
right-hand corner of their page, you will find rrdtool graphs for all the hosts
which shows their uptime as well as what OpenBSD version they are running. They
also share what kind of hardware the hosts are running on, and that they
provision at most 40 VMs per host, so they are quite transparent with their
setup.</p>
<p>Another thing I think is unique is that they allow you to SSH into the host, to
manage your VM with <code>vmctl</code> if you need to start or stop it, or access its console.</p>
<p>They do not have any web-interfaces to manage your VM, so SSH is it. I think this
is a far superior experience though, as many console web-interfaces I have tried have been very laggy,
and more problematic, have had a different keyboard mapping than mine. Having
special characters in my password, like <code>^</code>, <code>`</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>}</code> and <code>*</code> I have many
times struggled to log on in a web-interface as I couldn&rsquo;t find what key
combinations to use to get those characters.</p>
<p>To order a VPS, there&rsquo;s a large, friendly &ldquo;Book your VM&rdquo; button on their front-page.
Fill in your information, select your options and that is it. Memory and disk
can be increased later, so I went for the minimal option which is the default
1 GB RAM, 50 GB disk.</p>
<p>I ordered my VM around 8 in the evening Amsterdam time, and received the welcome
mail a little more than one hour later with the login details. Your experience
may vary here as I saw someone mention they got theirs mere minutes after ordering.</p>
<p>Do note that you will have to pay for the VM for a year in advance, so if you
just want to try OpenBSD, this may not be for you. The current price is €69
for a year, which works out to less than €6 per month, which I personally
think is reasonable. Here that price equals one, maybe two cups of take-away coffee a month.</p>
<p>For every new VM ordered they donate €10 to the OpenBSD Foundation, and
for every renewal they donate €15, so by being a customer you are helping fund
the people and the infrastructure behind OpenBSD, OpenSSH and so on. I&rsquo;ve not
seen anyone else do anything like that.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup<a href="#setup" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Back to the setup, having received the login details I was able to log in with
my wanted username, on the ip-address they gave, using my SSH-key.</p>
<p>As noted in the onboarding link provided in the email I received, I found
the root password in the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.</p>
<p>I changed that right away and setup <code>doas</code>, which OpenBSD uses instead of <code>sudo</code>
to execute commands as root.</p>
<p>Setting up doas is easy as my user was already a member of the group
<code>wheel</code>, and the default doas config allows users in this group to execute
commands. Group membership can be checked with the <code>id</code> command.</p>
<p>OpenBSD comes with a set of example configuration files in <code>/etc/examples</code> so
all I needed to do was copy <code>doas.conf</code> to <code>/etc</code> and I was good to go. Setting
a strong password for my account was also done at this point.</p>
<p>Now I have a config that works, but to make life a little more tolerable I added
a line to the doas config so I won&rsquo;t have to enter my password every time:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>permit persist &lt;username&gt;
</code></pre><p>This means I only have to give doas my password every so often, which seems to be
every 5 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Looking in <code>/var/mail</code> I found a file with my username. This contained
a log of the installation, so I could see exactly how it was done. I made a copy
of this as I&rsquo;m sure I want to reinstall my VM later to add full disk encryption (FDE).
Another nice surprise was that they ran <code>syspatch</code> as part of the
installation, meaning the VM already had the latest security patches applied. I
ordered my VM a little earlier this month, at which point 7.6 had been out for a
while, so it was nice to see all published patches were already installed. Patch
status can be checked by running <code>doas syspatch</code> which should return an empty output,
indicating that there was nothing to do as the system is up to date.</p>
<p>So then, what is running on our shiny, new OpenBSD VM? Not much it turns out
which I think is sensible, as there is no need to find out what everything
is and how to disable it to secure the system.</p>

</code></pre><p>All in all it feels like a very nice and clean and minimal system, at least in
the default setup. OpenBSD actually comes with a lot of services that can be
activated if you want, which I&rsquo;ll get back to later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. I&rsquo;m very happy with the process so far, the transparency of the
hosting provider and the initial setup.</p>
<p>Next up, change some things and add some services.</p>
