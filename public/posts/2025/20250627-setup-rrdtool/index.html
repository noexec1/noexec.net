<p>Having installed SNMP, it is time to measure something, store the measurements
in a database and finally make some pretty graphs of it all. The tool I&rsquo;m
using for all of that is RRDtool.</p>
<p>RRDtool, or &ldquo;round robin database tool&rdquo; as it stands for, is a database
specifically for storing data in time series. The way I understand this
is that the database is essentially a fixed-length list, and that when
you add an item, an item will be removed so the list is always the same
length. The time series part means that a key is time. You measure
something at a given time, store it in the database at this point in time,
and the oldest element will be removed.</p>
<p>RRDtool also comes with a tool to make graphs of what was stored, so you
can easily see the change over time.</p>
<p>You can store whatever measurements you want in an RRDtool database as
long as they are at somewhat regular intervals in time. I will be using
SNMP to capture CPU load and interface counters (network traffic) every
minute, store it and eventually make graphs of it.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a href="#installation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>RRDtool is fortunately available as a package for OpenBSD as can be found
with <code>pkg_info -Q rrdtool</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>collectd-rrdtool-5.12.0p3
debug-rrdtool-1.9.0
py3-rrdtool-0.1.16p3
rrdtool-1.9.0
</code></pre><p>The one we want is the last one and it can be easily installed with
<code>pkg_add rrdtool-1.9.0</code></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-database">Creating a database<a href="#creating-a-database" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>This part I have to admit I don&rsquo;t think I fully understand, even though
I&rsquo;ve done a lot of searching, reading, experimenting and copy/pasting to
get this working.</p>
<h3 id="rrd-for-cpu">RRD for CPU<a href="#rrd-for-cpu" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>The people behind OpenBSD.Amsterdam have written a little about their
configuration <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam/blog/rrdtool-looks-nicer.html">here</a> and I have tried to replicate that
for my server since I liked it. I will sort of dissect it here and go
through it as I understand it and explain my changes.</p>
<p>To start with, they create the database for CPU measurements like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>${RRDTOOL} create ${RRDFILES}/${HOST}-cpu.rrd \
        --step 300 \
        DS:ds0:GAUGE:600:U:U \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:1:20000
</code></pre><p>Since this is run from a script, <code>${RRDTOOL}</code> is path to the <code>rrdtool</code>
command and <code>${RRDFILES}/${HOST}-cpu.rrd</code> is path to where the database
should be stored, and they seem to have one file per host, each ending
with <code>-cpu.rrd</code>.</p>
<p>The next line, <code>--step 300</code> is how often in seconds measurements will
be recorded, in other words, once every 5 minutes. I will measure every
minute so my step will be 60.</p>
<p>Next comes DS, or data source. This line contains a lot so I want to break
it down further.</p>
<p><code>DS:ds0:GAUGE:600:U:U</code></p>
<p>The field <code>ds0</code> is the name of the data source, and it can be anything you
want as long as it&rsquo;s 1-19 characters long and containing only letters,
number or the underscore character. This will be referenced when creating
graphs.</p>
<p>The field <code>GAUGE</code> is the data source type. The documentation says this
about this type:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>is for things like temperatures or number of people in a room or the value of a RedHat share.
</code></pre><p>My interpretation of this is that it is for values that can seemingly
change at will, without being affected by previous readings, and so
will be stored as-is. Unfortunately that is not the whole picture as
there is something called a &ldquo;consolidation function&rdquo;, or CF for short,
that will be applied when we record data. I&rsquo;ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>For storing interface counters, or network traffic, I will be using the
COUNTER type, but more on that as I get to it.</p>
<p>Next on the data source line is the value 600. This field is called heartbeat,
and is the max number of seconds that may pass between two updates before
the value is considered to be unknown. In other words, if 600 or more seconds
have passed, twice the number of seconds of <code>step</code>, the value is recorded
as unknown. What can also be understood by this is that values doesn&rsquo;t have
to be recorded exactly at step boundaries, but there is some leverage as
defined by heartbeat.</p>
<p>The next two fields which are both <code>U</code> here define minimum and maximum value,
if known. If we don&rsquo;t know what they can be, we can set the fields to U as
is shown here. I&rsquo;m not sure what the max for CPU load can be, but I would
expect the minimum to be 0.</p>
<p>The next line defines the RRA, or round robin archive. This will contain
the data from each of the defined data sources.</p>
<p><code>RRA:MAX:0.5:1:20000</code></p>
<p>The field MAX is the aggregation consolidation function being used. Other
alternatives are AVERAGE, MIN and LAST. I don&rsquo;t really understand what
these do. It seems to me that the value I store is stored as-is, no matter
what aggregation function I use. It could be this comes into play if values
aren&rsquo;t stored at their time interval, or if multiple values are stored in
an interval, I don&rsquo;t know. I might look into that later.</p>
<p>The next field which here is 0.5 is called the xfiles factor which defines
how much of an interval may be made up of unknown values, while still being
considered to be known. 0.5 means that half the values may be unknown. I&rsquo;m
not sure about how this works, but I think it mostly applies if you store
multiple values and then let RRDtool do some calculation to get the final
value.</p>
<p>The next field containing the value 1 is steps, which defines how many primary
data points are used to build a consolidated data point. I think that for
xfiles factor to have an effect, this has to be greater than 1.</p>
<p>Then the final field is rows, which define how many values are kept. In this
example where we keep 20 000 values, and we record one value every 300 seconds
that works out to storing data for 69 days, 10 hours and 39 minutes. Or the
oldest value in the archive will be from that many days and hours ago. This is
nice if you want to create a graph that shows the measurements as they were
2 months ago, but if you don&rsquo;t need that kind of precision there are other
ways of doing this which I&rsquo;ll get back to.</p>
<h3 id="rrd-for-interface-counters">RRD for interface counters<a href="#rrd-for-interface-counters" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Next up is storing data from our network interface. Here we&rsquo;ll need two data-sources
as we can store traffic both incoming and outgoing.</p>
<p>Continuing with the example from before, they show this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>        --step 300 \
        DS:ds0:COUNTER:600:0:1250000000 \
        DS:ds1:COUNTER:600:0:1250000000  \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:600 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:6:700 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:24:775 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:797 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:1:600 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:6:700 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:24:775 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:288:797
</code></pre><p>Here it makes sense to use the COUNTER data type instead of GAUGE. RRDtool
has logic built in to handle values that wrap around when using this data
type.</p>
<p>One thing about this example I don&rsquo;t think makes sense is the 1250000000
max value. It is 1 250 000 000 bytes, which works out to be 10 000 000 000 bits
which looks like the network port speed, 10 GB/s. The interface counters we
query with SNMP are either 32- or 64-bits and wrap around at 4 294 967 296 or
18 446 744 073 709 551 616 bytes respectively. That last number is 18 quintillion,
or 18 million million million bytes.</p>
<p>In any case, they show how multiple archives can be defined with varying degree
of precision for older data. The first RRA is similar to the CPU example, but
only keeping an average of the data for about 2 days. The next is a little more
interesting as it requires 6 values before storing one value as the average of the
6. With 6 values and a step of 300, one value will be stored every 30 minutes.
Then keeping 700 in this archive, it stores data for around 14.5 days. The next
are one value every 2 hours times 775 which is 64.5 days and the last is one
value per day for 797 days. Then they do the same for the MAX values in the
recorded interval.</p>
<p>I wrote all that as I&rsquo;ve been trying to make sense of it all, and I personally think
those numbers are a little random so I&rsquo;ll be using other ones. You are now of
course very welcome to tell me I haven&rsquo;t understood this at all and got everything
completely wrong. I&rsquo;d welcome the learning oportunity! Please reach out on <a href="https://noexec.net/mastodon/">Mastodon</a>
if I&rsquo;m mistaken and you can explain how this really works!</p>
<h3 id="my-rrd-for-cpu">My RRD for CPU<a href="#my-rrd-for-cpu" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Getting right into it, I defined the database for CPU load like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>        --step 60 \
        DS:ds0:GAUGE:120:U:U \
        RRA:LAST:0.5:1:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:10:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:20:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:30:1440
</code></pre><p>In short, I aim to insert one value every minute, if more than two
minutes has passed consider the value unknown, and I have the following archives:</p>
<p>The actual values are stored for 24 hours, then I keep the 5 minute average
for 5 days, 10 minute average for 10 days, 20 minute average for 20 days
and 30 minute average for 30 days.</p>
<h3 id="my-rrd-for-interface-counters">My RRD for interface counters<a href="#my-rrd-for-interface-counters" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>This is quite similar to the CPU database, just that I&rsquo;m also keeping
the max value recorded:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>        --step 60 \
        DS:ds0:COUNTER:120:0:U \
        DS:ds1:COUNTER:120:0:U \
        RRA:LAST:0.5:1:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:5:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:10:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:20:1440 \
        RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:30:1440 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:1:1440 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:5:1440 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:10:1440 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:20:1440 \
        RRA:MAX:0.5:30:1440
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;ve set minimum value to be 0, but maximum to be unknown so RRDtool won&rsquo;t
perform any sanity checks on it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-data">Getting the data<a href="#getting-the-data" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I wrote about SNMP, what commands to use and the relevant oid&rsquo;s in my <a href="https://noexec.net/posts/2025/20250502-setup-snmpd/">previous post</a>.
Please read that for more details.</p>
<p>Since my VPS only has one CPU it is easy to get the data for it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ snmp get -A &#34;Dash A pass&#34; -a SHA-256 -l authPriv -u user -X &#34;Dash X pass&#34; localhost hrProcessorLoad.1
</code></pre><p>If you have more, you have multiple options. You can get each value individually
and combine them all in a graph so you can see load across CPUs, or you can
combine them and show the average. Instead of getting them each one by one
you can list them all at once with the walk paramter as shown in the previous
post, and then do some scripting magic to get the number(s) you want.</p>
<p>For the interface counters I found it is a little more complex. Like for CPU
the exact ID for the interface is needed, it can&rsquo;t be referenced by name, but
I found that an interface can change ID. At least I think the Wireguard interface
did, but that may be because I started and destroyed it a lot when doing some
testing. I think it&rsquo;s fairly safe to assume that our main interface, vio0, will
always be the first, but to make sure I do the following:</p>

<h3 id="32-vs-64-bit-counters">32 vs 64-bit counters<a href="#32-vs-64-bit-counters" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about 32 vs 64-bit counters. Both are available to
read from for interface counters. The 32-bit counter for incoming
traffic is called <code>ifInOctets.1</code> for interface 1, and the 64-bit
counter for the same is called <code>ifHCInOctets.1</code>. The counters for
outgoing traffic simply have <code>Out</code> in their name instead of <code>In</code>.</p>
<p>Now what are the difference between them, or why would we use one over
the other? One important aspect is that these counters only go up unless
reset due to a reboot for instance, and that they wrap around, meaning
start again from 0 when they exceed their max value.</p>
<p>To take the 64-bit counter first, it goes up to 18 quintillion and that
number is so large it&rsquo;s unlikely to wrap around in my lifetime. If I got
my math right, at a constant 10 Gbit/s it would take over 460 years to
exceed its max value.</p>
<p>The 32-bit counter however, &ldquo;only&rdquo; goes up to around 4 GB before it
wraps around, and that limit is quite easy to reach. So then, what
happens if we read and store one value around 4 GB, and the next one
is 1 GB? Fortunately RRDtool is &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of this, or more correctly has
built-in logic to handle this, and is able to calculate how much the
counter increased before it wrapped around. That means it can calculate
the correct usage amount for the interval, instead of suddenly showing
a negative number.</p>
<p>This can be a problem if the intervals are long and/or the interfaces
are high speed with a lot of traffic. If the counter has wrapped around
multiple times between one reading and the next, RRDtool won&rsquo;t know and
can&rsquo;t calculate that, and will return a number a lot lower than the actual
usage. In this scenario it might be necessary to use the 64-bit counter.</p>
<p>One final thing, if the 64-bit counter solves this quick wrap around
problem, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense to just always use it? Well, here the
problem is that if the interface is reset somehow perhaps because of
a reboot, RRDtool will see a new number lower than the previous and
calculate how much traffic must have passed to cause it to wrap around.
That gives a high peak on the graph, basically making it unreadable
as long as it is within the graph interval.</p>
<p>I see that this can be fixed by setting a max value or by using the
data source type DERIVE instead of COUNTER, but that is a little
beyond me still.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s something to be aware of.</p>
<h2 id="the-scripts">The scripts<a href="#the-scripts" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Putting it all together, here are the scripts I&rsquo;m currently using to
record data. Since SNMP needs certain things like passwords, username
and host on every command, I&rsquo;ve put that into its own file which I
source at the beginning of all the scripts that need it:</p>
<p><code>/home/user/rrdtool/env.sh</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>USER=&#34;user&#34;
AUTHPASS=&#34;Dash A pass&#34;
PRIVPASS=&#34;Dash X pass&#34;

RRDFILES=&#34;/home/user/rrdtool/dbfiles&#34;
RRDTOOL=&#34;/usr/local/bin/rrdtool&#34;
</code></pre><p>Then I have a main script which calls the other scripts. This is the one
I start from crontab every minute:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I always check if the RRD file exists before trying to update it. If it doesn&rsquo;t
exist, it will be created. It may be a little more work each time, but it
means the script will work the first time, and I won&rsquo;t have to remember to
create the database files first. It also means I can just delete the files
if I want to start fresh, or move them out of the way to have them archived
for instance.</p>
<p>One thing to note here that I have not mentioned before is that RRDtool
in addition to aggregating the data according to the consolidation function,
will also perform normalization on the data. In other words, if values aren&rsquo;t
stored at the exact time they are expected to be, RRDtool will guess what
they would have been, if they had been.</p>
<p>For another explanation of this, see this article: <a href="http://rrdtool.vandenbogaerdt.nl/process.php">Rates, normalizing and consolidating</a></p>
<p>We can look at the data with the fetch command, and this is what it looks
like when it is empty, not containing any values:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ rrdtool fetch cpu.rrd LAST
1751219640: nan
1751219700: nan
1751219760: nan
1751219820: nan
1751219880: nan
1751219940: nan
1751220000: nan
</code></pre><p>Now I can update the database with the value 10 at exactly an expected time like this:
<code>rrdtool update cpu.rrd '1751219700:10'</code></p>
<p>The database now contains this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ rrdtool fetch cpu.rrd LAST
1751219640: nan
1751219700: 1.0000000000e+01
1751219760: nan
1751219820: nan
1751219880: nan
1751219940: nan
1751220000: nan
</code></pre><p>Now observe the results if I update the database 2 seconds after the expected time instead:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ rrdtool update cpu.rrd &#39;1751219762:20&#39;
$ rrdtool update cpu.rrd &#39;1751219822:10&#39;
$ rrdtool update cpu.rrd &#39;1751219882:30&#39;
$ rrdtool update cpu.rrd &#39;1751219942:10&#39;
$ rrdtool fetch cpu.rrd LAST
1751219640: nan
1751219700: 1.0000000000e+01
1751219760: 2.0000000000e+01
1751219820: 1.0333333333e+01
1751219880: 2.9333333333e+01
1751219940: 1.0666666667e+01
1751220000: nan
</code></pre><p>The next value, 20, is fine, but look at what happens to the values after that.
The next 10 is stored as 10.3, while the 30 is stored as 29.33 and the final
10 is stored as 10.6.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge difference and it&rsquo;s not exactly breaking anything, I just
want these values to be exactly as I read them in. Part of the reason is
that RRDtool can&rsquo;t really guess what happened in between, so it can&rsquo;t know
if the value really was increasing or decreasing at the exact minute compared
to when I made the update.</p>
<p>So to achive exact values I fudge the timestamp a little bit with this line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">TIMESTAMP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>date <span class="s1">&#39;+%s&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> cut -c 1-9<span class="k">)</span><span class="m">0</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This gets unixtime in seconds, cuts of the last number and adds a 0 instead.
As long as my script now runs within the first 9 seconds of the minute,
the reading will be logged at exactly the minute.</p>
<p>The line that updates the database is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">RRDTOOL</span><span class="si">}</span> update <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">RRDCPU</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">TIMESTAMP</span><span class="si">}</span>:<span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">CPULOAD</span><span class="si">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you don&rsquo;t care about fudging the time like I do, replace <code>${TIMESTAMP}</code>
with <code>N</code> and RRDtool will use whatever time is current time.</p>
<p>Now on to getting the interface counters. This script is called twice,
once for the vio0 interface, then again for the wg0 interface.</p>

<p>This post took a lot longer to write than I expected, I started it three days
ago, as there was a lot to look into. I had cobbled together some scripts
that were working, but to present them here I felt the need to clean them
up a little. Then there was a lot to look into to make sure what I wrote
wasn&rsquo;t completely wrong. And I think I learned a lot in the process and
understand RRDtool a little better now.</p>
<p>So the graphs will have to come later, I have to clean up those scripts too,
and it will be its own post.</p>
